# `u` wants to be a [[WriteItYourself|Write-It-Yourself]] language

It means, then you don't need to learn `u` but write it yourself, and thus understand every single in it. As a result, to make this task to be possible, `u` must also be as simple as ever can be done. While we hear this phrase, somebody may recall another language that goes this way -- the famous and scary FORTH.

Yes, making `u` I also took in mind to write some new language especially designed to be embeddable and run on low-end [[microcontroller|microcontrollers]], which has the feel of FORTH but avoids its dark sides, but gots the power of simplest programming language can be made.

Internal simplicity is very important, when we speak about every newbie should write his own implementation of the `u` language. Every next language feature doubles the complexity and forces the user to be more and more skilled to go. If you take some more or less known embeddable languages such as Lua, Python, or maybe Lisp, only a programmer with some skills in compiler design and language implementation can reimplement the language.

## Why it is important?

- you know every line of your language implementation
- you can change anything on a wish
- there are only a few tutorials that exist about making your own language not forcing you to be a CS Ph.D. or senior software engineer

## next: `u` targets on [[microcontroller|microcontrollers]]
