# low-memory addressing
#u #bytecode 

Low-end [[microcontroller|microcontrollers]] has not more than 20K of RAM in total, so it looks unreasonable to use full-sized 32bit memory addresses. Also, we still have a bit obsoleted 8/16bit MCUs such as AVR and MSP430, which are still in use at least in existing long-term projects. Some rare applications also use old 8bit processors mostly in legacy control systems and retrocomputing.
